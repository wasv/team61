======

This branch will contain all code for the FRC Team 61 Robot. The code is written in Java using NetBeans, 
using the WPI Robotics Library.

To add this repository to NetBeans, do the following:

	1. Go to Team > Git > Clone...
	2. If you are asked for a master password, enter it now.
	3a. For the Repository URL, use: https://github.com/tboelke/team61.git
	3b. Set your username and password to what you use to log into github.*
	4. On the next page, check the box that is labeled "master".
	5. Leave everything as default on the next page, making sure "Scan for NetBeans Projects after Clone" is checked.

* - You can also leave it blank, but as it says in the wizard, that will leave you as anonymous (read-only).
